# Devilbox Artwork

> The **[Devilbox](https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox)** is a modern and highly customisable **dockerized PHP stack** supporting full **LAMP** and **MEAN** and running on all major platforms. The main goal is to easily switch and combine any version required for local development. It supports an **unlimited number of projects** for which **vhosts**, **SSL certificates** and **DNS records** are created automatically. **Reverse proxies** per project are supported to ensure listening server such as NodeJS can also be reached. Email catch-all and popular development tools will be at your service as well. Configuration is not necessary, as everything is already pre-setup.

> Furthermore, the Devilbox provides an **identical** and **reproducible development environment** for different host operating systems.
